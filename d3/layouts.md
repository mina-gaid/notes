# D3 Layouts

D3 has a number of layout functions. Layout functions sets up and modifies data so that it can be rendered in different shapes. The layout functions don't do the drawing of the shapes.

## Pie Layout

The pie layout is a part of the `d3-shape` module. 

```bash
npm install d3-shape
```

A pie layout transforms data by adding start and end angle values to each item in the data array so that it can be rendered as a pie chart. It is used in conjunction with a `d3.arc` (also part of `d3-shapes`) to draw the pieces of the pie. If the arc function is passed an inner radius, the pie chart can be rendered as a donut chart.

The pie layout has a number of methods that you can use to control how the start and end angles are determined.

```js
import { pie } from 'd3-shape';

const pie = d3.pie()
  // set how to get the value being charted from each datum
  .value(function(d){ return d.count; })
  // set the sort function (or null to leave in original order)
  .sort(null)
  // set the start angle of the first datum in radians (default 0)
  .startAngle(Math.PI/2)
  // set the end angle in radians (default 2*Math.PI)
  .endAngle((5/2)*Math.PI)
  // set padding between arcs in radians (default 0)
  .padAngle(0);
```

If you want your pie chart to be a full circle, the difference between the start angle and the end angle should be 2Ï€ radians.

Once your pie layout function has been configured, pass it your data array. This will return an array of objects which have the `data` for the corresponding datum as well as `startAngle` and `endAngle` properties.

```js
// mock data
const data = [
  {name: 'US', count: 11},
  {name: 'Germany', count: 5},
  {name: 'United Kingdom', count: 7},
  {name: 'Canada', count: 13},
  {name: 'Norway', count: 4}
];

// transform our data to have relevant properties
// for rendering a pie chart
const pieData = pie(data);
```

The pie chart is made up of arcs which are drawn using an `arc` generator. The arc generator can be configured using a number of methods, but the two most important are `outerRadius` and `innerRadius`. The `outerRadius` method defines the radius of the pie chart. The default inner radius is 0, but you can provide a number larger than that using the `innerRadius` method to create a donut chart.

```js
import { arc } from 'd3-shape';

// create an arc function to calculate angles
// for arcs in the data
const arc = arc()
  .outerRadius(100)
  .innerRadius(0);
```

Once our arc generator has been configured, create a selection of `&lt;path&gt;` elements and bind it to the data array returned by the pie layout function. The arc generator function is used to create the `d` attribute of each path.

```js
svg.selectAll('path.arc')
    .data(pieData)
  .enter().append('path')
    .classed('arc', true)
    .attr('d', arc);
```

## Tree Layout

The tree layout is part of the `d3-hierarchy` module.

```bash
npm install d3-hierarchy
```

Tree layouts can be useful for displaying nested information. In order to create a tree, you will need to have nested data and also use both the `hierarchy` and `tree`  functions.

### `hierarchy` function

The `hierarchy` function takes your nested data, creates a `Node` object for each datum, and returns the root `Node`. It can also take a second argument, which is a function that returns a datum's children. It is only necessary to include this if the child datum aren't in the datum's `children` property.

Each `Node` created by the `hierarchy` function has properties that will be used by the `tree` function to create the layout:

* `data` - The datum object from your data that is associated with this node.
* `depth` - The depth of the node. The root node has depth 0, its children have depth 1, and so on and so forth.
* `height` - The height of the node is the longest distance from the node to a leaf node (a node with no children). A leaf node has a height of 0.
* `parent` - A reference to the node's parent node.
* `children` - An array of child nodes for a node. This only exists if the node has child nodes.

```js
import { hierarchy } from 'd3-hierarchy';

const data = {
  name: 'parent',
  children: [
    {name: 'child1'},
    {name: 'child2'}
  ]
};

const root = hierarchy(data);
/*
 * root === Node(data={name: 'parent'}, ...)
 */
```

The `Node` object has a number of methods. The most important of these for a tree layout are the `descendants` and `links` methods. The `descendants` method returns an array containing all the node and every descendant node. Calling this on the root node will give you an array of every node. The `links` method creates an object for each connection between a parent and a child node in the tree. In each object, the parent node is the `source` and the child node is the `target`.


```js
const descendants = root.descendants();
/*
 * descendants === [Node(...), Node(...), Node(...)]
 */
const links = root.links();
/*
 * links === [
 *  {
 *    source: Node(data={name: 'parent'}, ...)
 *    target: Node(data={name: 'child1'}, ...)
 *  }, ...
 * ]
 */
```

### `tree` function

The `tree` function takes a `Node` object and calculates the position for it and all of its descendant nodes in the tree. It does this by creating a `TreeNode` for each node and then walking through the tree nodes to determine the positioning of each, adding those values to the nodes.

The tree layout can be controlled using its `separation`, `size`, and `nodeSize` methods. The `separation` method takes a function which returns the amount of separation there should be between two nodes drawn near each other. `size` takes an array containing the width and height of the tree. For a vertical tree (top-down), the array should be `[width, height]`. For a horizontal tree (left-right), the array should be `[height, width]`. `nodeSize` is used to specify the size of each node using an array containing the width and height of each node. For the `size` and `nodeSize` methods, only one can be active on a tree. If both are called, the second one will be the one that is used.

```js
import { tree } from 'd3-hierarchy';

const tree = tree()
  .size([200, 400]);
tree(root);
```

### Drawing the Tree

Now that you have your data setup to render a tree, its time to actually draw it. You will need to draw two things: the nodes and the links between the nodes.

To draw the nodes, call the `descendants` method of the root node to get an array of all of the nodes.

```js
const nodes = root.descendants();
```

Each node has an `x` and `y` property. You can use these to translate each node to the correct position. The `x` and `y` properties don't know the orientation of your tree. If you are using a vertical tree, you can use them as expected, but for a horizontal tree the values will have to be swapped.

```js
svg.selectAll('g.node')
    .data(root.descendants())
  .enter().append('g')
    .classed('node', true)
    // for a horizontal tree, d => `translate(${d.y},${d.x})
    .attr('transform', d => `translate(${d.x},${d.y}))
```

To draw the links, call the `links` method of the root node. This will return an array of objects, each one having a `source` and a `target` node. You can then generate a path between the two nodes.

```js
function drawLink(node) {
  const context = d3.path();
  const { source, target } = node;
  context.moveTo(target.y, target.x);
  context.bezierCurveTo(
    (target.y + source.y)/2, target.x,
    (target.y + source.y)/2, source.x,
    source.y, source.x
  );
  return context.toString();
}

svg.selectAll('path')
    .data(root.links())
  .enter().append('path')
    .style('fill', 'none')
    .style('stroke', '#444')
    .attr('d', drawLink);
```
